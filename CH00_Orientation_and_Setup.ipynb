Pure Python, no external libraries.\n- **Part 2 (Chapters 3–4): Data Science Foundations** — NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. The tools every data scientist uses daily.\n- **Part 3 (Chapters 5–9): Machine Learning & AI** — SciPy, scikit-learn, PyTorch, Keras 3, NLP, Hugging Face Transformers, and professional deployment practices.\n\n### The Project Thread\n\nA single dataset — the **Stack Overflow 2025 Developer Survey** — runs through every chapter.  \nYou will load it in Chapter 0, clean it in Chapter 3, visualize it in Chapter 4, build ML models on it in Chapters 6 and 7, run NLP on its text fields in Chapter 8, and deploy a model trained on it in Chapter 9.\n\nThis continuity is intentional: real data science work involves a single dataset across many weeks and many techniques. This book mirrors that reality.\n\n### How to Use Each Notebook\n\nEvery chapter notebook follows the same structure:\n1. **Section header** — context and learning objectives\n2. **Pre-code explanation** — plain-English description of what the code does and why\n3. **Code cell** — Python code with inline comments explaining *why* each line works\n4. **Post-code interpretation** — what the output means, common errors, key takeaways\n5. **Chapter summary** — skills gained and preview of what's next\n\n> 💡 **The Golden Rule:** Comments in every code cell explain **WHY** a line works, not just what it does.  \n> Bad: `# multiply by 2`  \n> Good: `# divide by maximum value to compress all salaries into the 0–1 range that gradient descent needs`\n"

Go to [anaconda.com/download](https://www.anaconda.com/download)\n2. Download the installer for your OS (Windows / macOS / Linux)\n3. Run the installer — accept defaults for most options\n4. Open **Anaconda Navigator** or the **Anaconda Prompt**\n5. Verify: `python --version` should show Python 3.11+\n\n**Creating a dedicated environment for this book:**\n```bash\n# Create a new environment named 'pyaiml' with Python 3.11\nconda create -n pyaiml python=3.11\n\n# Activate the environment\nconda activate pyaiml\n\n# Install core packages\npip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn scipy\npip install torch torchvision --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu121\npip install keras transformers datasets plotly xgboost lightgbm optuna\npip install jupyter notebook fastapi uvicorn\n\n# Launch Jupyter Notebook\njupyter notebook\n```\n\n---\n\n### Option B: VS Code + Python Extension\n\nVS Code with the Python extension is the most popular IDE for Python development.\n\n1. Download VS Code from [code.visualstudio.com](https://code.visualstudio.com)\n2. Install the **Python extension** (by Microsoft) from the Extensions marketplace\n3. Install the **Jupyter extension** to run `.ipynb` notebooks locally\n4. Select your conda environment (or any Python interpreter) via `Ctrl+Shift+P → Python: Select Interpreter`\n\n---\n\n### Virtual Environments (venv — built into Python)\n\nIf you prefer not to use Anaconda, Python's built-in `venv` module creates lightweight isolated environments:\n\n```bash\n# Create a virtual environment in a folder named '.venv'\npython -m venv .venv\n\n# Activate it (macOS/Linux)\nsource .venv/bin/activate\n\n# Activate it (Windows)\n.venv\\Scripts\\activate\n\n# Install packages\npip install -r requirements.txt   # if the repo includes one\n```\n\n> 📌 **Key principle:** Always use a dedicated environment per project. Never install packages into your system Python.\n"
