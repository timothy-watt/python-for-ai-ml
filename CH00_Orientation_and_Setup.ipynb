Pure Python, no external libraries.\n- **Part 2 (Chapters 3–4): Data Science Foundations** — NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. The tools every data scientist uses daily.\n- **Part 3 (Chapters 5–9): Machine Learning & AI** — SciPy, scikit-learn, PyTorch, Keras 3, NLP, Hugging Face Transformers, and professional deployment practices.\n\n### The Project Thread\n\nA single dataset — the **Stack Overflow 2025 Developer Survey** — runs through every chapter.  \nYou will load it in Chapter 0, clean it in Chapter 3, visualize it in Chapter 4, build ML models on it in Chapters 6 and 7, run NLP on its text fields in Chapter 8, and deploy a model trained on it in Chapter 9.\n\nThis continuity is intentional: real data science work involves a single dataset across many weeks and many techniques. This book mirrors that reality.\n\n### How to Use Each Notebook\n\nEvery chapter notebook follows the same structure:\n1. **Section header** — context and learning objectives\n2. **Pre-code explanation** — plain-English description of what the code does and why\n3. **Code cell** — Python code with inline comments explaining *why* each line works\n4. **Post-code interpretation** — what the output means, common errors, key takeaways\n5. **Chapter summary** — skills gained and preview of what's next\n\n> 💡 **The Golden Rule:** Comments in every code cell explain **WHY** a line works, not just what it does.  \n> Bad: `# multiply by 2`  \n> Good: `# divide by maximum value to compress all salaries into the 0–1 range that gradient descent needs`\n"

Go to [anaconda.com/download](https://www.anaconda.com/download)\n2. Download the installer for your OS (Windows / macOS / Linux)\n3. Run the installer — accept defaults for most options\n4. Open **Anaconda Navigator** or the **Anaconda Prompt**\n5. Verify: `python --version` should show Python 3.11+\n\n**Creating a dedicated environment for this book:**\n```bash\n# Create a new environment named 'pyaiml' with Python 3.11\nconda create -n pyaiml python=3.11\n\n# Activate the environment\nconda activate pyaiml\n\n# Install core packages\npip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn scipy\npip install torch torchvision --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu121\npip install keras transformers datasets plotly xgboost lightgbm optuna\npip install jupyter notebook fastapi uvicorn\n\n# Launch Jupyter Notebook\njupyter notebook\n```\n\n---\n\n### Option B: VS Code + Python Extension\n\nVS Code with the Python extension is the most popular IDE for Python development.\n\n1. Download VS Code from [code.visualstudio.com](https://code.visualstudio.com)\n2. Install the **Python extension** (by Microsoft) from the Extensions marketplace\n3. Install the **Jupyter extension** to run `.ipynb` notebooks locally\n4. Select your conda environment (or any Python interpreter) via `Ctrl+Shift+P → Python: Select Interpreter`\n\n---\n\n### Virtual Environments (venv — built into Python)\n\nIf you prefer not to use Anaconda, Python's built-in `venv` module creates lightweight isolated environments:\n\n```bash\n# Create a virtual environment in a folder named '.venv'\npython -m venv .venv\n\n# Activate it (macOS/Linux)\nsource .venv/bin/activate\n\n# Activate it (Windows)\n.venv\\Scripts\\activate\n\n# Install packages\npip install -r requirements.txt   # if the repo includes one\n```\n\n> 📌 **Key principle:** Always use a dedicated environment per project. Never install packages into your system Python.\n"

Answer each question without referring back to the notebook, then expand to check.\n\n**Q1.** What is the difference between a Colab **Runtime** and a Colab **Notebook**?\n\n<details><summary>Show answer</summary>\n\nA **notebook** is the file (`.ipynb`) that stores your code and text cells. A **runtime** is the virtual machine that actually executes that code. You can restart or reset the runtime without losing the notebook file.\n\n</details>\n\n**Q2.** Why does `import pandas` fail immediately after you restart the Colab runtime, even though you ran `!pip install pandas` earlier?\n\n<details><summary>Show answer</summary>\n\n`!pip install` installs a package into the runtime's Python environment. When you restart the runtime, a fresh environment starts — the package is still installed (Colab caches it), but all Python variables and imports are cleared. You need to re-run the `import` cell.\n\n</details>\n\n**Q3.** What is the purpose of mounting Google Drive in Colab?\n\n<details><summary>Show answer</summary>\n\nBy default, files written in a Colab session are stored in the runtime's ephemeral `/content/` directory and are lost when the runtime ends. Mounting Drive maps your Drive folder to `/content/drive/`, so files written there persist between sessions.\n\n</details>\n\n**Q4.** Name two differences between a T4 GPU runtime and a CPU runtime in Colab.\n\n<details><summary>Show answer</summary>\n\n1. **Speed:** GPU runtimes use NVIDIA T4 GPUs which can be 10–50x faster for deep learning training. 2. **Memory:** T4 GPUs have 16 GB of dedicated VRAM separate from system RAM. GPU runtimes are also time-limited (~12 hrs continuous) and may queue during high demand.\n\n</details>\n\n**Q5.** You open a classmate's notebook and the first cell is `df = pd.read_csv('data.csv')`. The file is nowhere in the repo. What are two ways to fix this?\n\n<details><summary>Show answer</summary>\n\n1. **Host the file publicly** (e.g., in GitHub or Google Drive) and replace the path with a URL: `pd.read_csv('https://...')`. 2. **Mount Drive** and store `data.csv` there, then update the path to `'/content/drive/MyDrive/data.csv'`.\n\n</details>\n\n"

Trains a `GradientBoostingClassifier` on a fixed synthetic dataset\n   `n_runs` times with `random_state=42`\n2. Asserts that all runs produce *identical* predictions on a held-out set\n3. Returns `True` if reproducible, `False` otherwise\n4. Then runs it again WITHOUT `random_state` and reports whether results vary.\nThis tests your understanding of why `random_state` matters.\n"
