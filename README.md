A free, self-contained textbook for learning Python, data science, machine learning, and AI — from first principles to production. Every chapter runs in Google Colab with no local setup required. The entire book is built around a single real-world dataset: the **Stack Overflow 2025 Developer Survey**.

## What Makes This Book Different

**One dataset, start to finish.** The Stack Overflow 2025 Developer Survey runs through every chapter as a continuous project thread — you're not switching to toy examples every few pages. By Chapter 12, you've built, audited, secured, and deployed the same salary prediction system you started in Chapter 6.

**Depth where most books skip.** Most ML textbooks end at model training. This one covers what comes after: fairness auditing (Chapter 10), adversarial robustness and red teaming (Chapter 11), MLOps and drift monitoring (Chapter 12), supply chain security (Appendix H), and a dedicated troubleshooting guide for the bugs that don't crash your code but ruin your models (Appendix I).

**Built for active learning.** Every chapter contains concept-check questions with collapsible answers (69 total), and three coding exercises at progressive difficulty levels — guided scaffolds, applied challenges, and open-ended extensions (39 total, all using the SO 2025 dataset).

**Zero setup.** Everything runs in Google Colab. Free T4 GPU access covers all deep learning chapters.

## Who This Is For

| Background | Where to start |
|-----------|----------------|
| No programming experience | Chapter 0 |
| Some Python, new to data science | Chapter 3 |
| Python + data science, new to ML | Chapter 6 |
| ML background, learning deep learning | Chapter 7 |

---

## Prerequisites

- A Google account (for Google Colab)
- No local Python installation required
- Chapters 0–5: no prior programming assumed
- Chapters 6–12: basic Python familiarity helpful (Chapters 1–2 cover this)

---

## The Dataset

All chapters use the **Stack Overflow 2025 Developer Survey** — a real-world dataset of ~15,000 curated responses covering programming languages, salaries, tools, education, and demographics. The dataset is included in the `/data` directory and loaded automatically in each notebook.

---

## Suggested Learning Paths

**Complete beginner (53–68 hours):** Chapters 0 → 12 in order, plus appendices as needed.

**Python-literate, new to ML (30–40 hours):** Start at Chapter 3, skim Chapters 1–2 as reference.

**ML practitioner adding depth (15–20 hours):** Chapters 7–12 + Appendices H and I.

**Responsible AI focus:** Chapters 6, 10, 11 + Appendix H.

**Production / MLOps focus:** Chapters 6, 7, 12 + Appendices G, H, I.
