Python for AI/ML: A Complete Learning Journey is a free, open-source textbook covering Python, data science, machine learning, and AI; from first principles to production deployment. The entire book runs in Google Colab with no local setup required, and every chapter is built around a single real-world dataset: the Stack Overflow 2025 Developer Survey. Across 13 chapters and 9 appendices, the book progresses from Python fundamentals through NumPy, Pandas, scikit-learn, PyTorch, NLP, computer vision, ethics and bias auditing, adversarial ML and model security, and MLOps. Unlike most ML resources, it doesn't stop at model training; it covers what practitioners actually encounter after deployment: fairness evaluation, adversarial robustness, drift monitoring, supply chain security, and a dedicated troubleshooting guide for the bugs that don't crash your code but quietly ruin your models. Every chapter includes concept-check questions with collapsible answers and three coding exercises at progressive difficulty levels, all using the same dataset for consistency.
